# Secure HTTPS Server using a Self-Managed PKI

This project demonstrates the complete process of building a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) from scratch to secure a web server using TLS/SSL. In this exercise, I acted as my own Root Certificate Authority (CA) to issue a valid X.509 certificate for a web server, providing a hands-on understanding of the chain of trust that secures modern internet communications.

### Core Concepts Demonstrated
*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** The framework of hardware, software, and policies used to manage digital certificates and public-key encryption.
*   **Certificate Authority (CA):** An entity that issues digital certificates. In this project, I created my own Root CA.
*   **X.509 Certificates:** The standard format for public-key certificates, containing a public key and identity information, all signed by a CA.
*   **Chain of Trust:** The hierarchical model where certificates are validated by tracing them back to a trusted Root CA.
*   **TLS/SSL:** The cryptographic protocols used to provide secure communication over a computer network.

### Tools Used
*   **OpenSSL:** The primary command-line tool used for all cryptographic operations.
*   **Ubuntu (Linux VM):** The operating environment for the server and CA.
*   **Mozilla Firefox:** Used as the client to verify the certificate and secure connection.

## Project Walkthrough

The project was executed in four distinct phases, from creating the trusted authority to deploying the secure server.

### Phase 1: Becoming a Root Certificate Authority (CA)
The first step was to create our own trusted authority. This CA's "root" certificate is the anchor of trust for any certificates it issues.

**1.1. Generate the CA's Private Key:**
This command creates a 2048-bit RSA private key, which will be used to sign all certificates issued by our CA. It is the most critical and sensitive file in the PKI.
```bash
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
genrsa: Command to generate an RSA private key.
out ca.key: Specifies the output filename for the private key.
2048: The length of the key in bits.

**1.2. Create the CA's Self-Signed Root Certificate:
Using the private key, we generate a self-signed root certificate. This certificate contains the CA's public key and its identity information. Being self-signed, it forms the beginning of the chain of trust.

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
req: Command for creating certificate requests and certificates.
-new: Prompts the user for the information needed in a certificate.
-x509: Specifies that we want to create a self-signed certificate, not a request (CSR).
-key ca.key: Uses our CA's private key to sign the certificate.

Phase 2: Generating a Certificate for the Web Server
The web server needs its own unique identity (key and certificate) to prove who it is to clients.
2.1. Generate the Server's Private Key:
Just like the CA, the server needs its own private key.
Generated bash
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
Use code with caution.
Bash
2.2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
The server's public key and identity information are bundled into a CSR. This request will be sent to our CA to be officially signed. The "Common Name" (CN) here is criticalâ€”it must match the domain name of the server (e.g., utscrypto.com.au).
Generated bash
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
Use code with caution.
Bash
Phase 3: Signing the Server's Certificate
As the CA, we now process the server's CSR and sign it with our CA private key, officially issuing a valid certificate.
3.1. Issue the Server Certificate:
This command takes the server's CSR and validates it using our CA's key and certificate. The output is a signed server.crt file that is trusted by anyone who trusts our ca.crt.
Generated bash
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
Use code with caution.
Bash
-in server.csr: Specifies the input CSR file.
-CA ca.crt: Specifies the CA's certificate to be used for signing.
-CAkey ca.key: Specifies the CA's private key to sign with.
-CAcreateserial: Generates a unique serial number for the certificate, which is a best practice.
Phase 4: Deploying and Testing the HTTPS Server
With the signed certificate, we can now run a secure web server.
4.1. Configure and Run the Server:
We combine the server's key and new certificate into a single .pem file and start a test server with OpenSSL.
Generated bash
# Combine the key and certificate into one file
cat server.key server.crt > server.pem

# Start the test HTTPS server
openssl s_server -cert server.pem -www```

**4.2. Verification:**
When first visiting the site (`https://utscrypto.com.au:4433`), the browser shows a "Potential Security Risk" error. This is expected because our self-made CA is not in the browser's default list of trusted authorities.

To complete the chain of trust, I manually imported the `ca.crt` file into the Firefox "Authorities" list. After re-visiting the page, the browser displayed the **lock icon (ðŸ”’)**, confirming that the server's certificate was successfully validated against our now-trusted Root CA.
-out ca.crt: Specifies the output filename for the certificate.
